# Spectra correctness

How often Spectra is right, measured on real code and compared with other tools **inside the same category**.
Speed and memory live in [`BENCHMARK.md`](BENCHMARK.md); the harness is in [`bench/`](bench/README.md).

Status: first measurement (RabbitMQ). The property-based corpus (PropEr) and the seeded-fault (mutation) corpus are not written yet.

## Like-for-like: discrepancies

`spectra check` mixes four kinds of warning (discrepancy, gradual contract, dead code, oxbow), and Dialyzer only reports
the first one plus some dead code, so the full counts are not comparable. Here Spectra runs with
`mode => discrepancy, oxbow => false` through the API (the escript has no `--mode` option yet: it would read it as a path)
and Dialyzer with its default warnings and the erts/kernel/stdlib PLT.

Corpus: rabbitmq-server `5dacb85` (see `bench/corpus.config.json`).

| Corpus | Spectra (discrepancy mode) | Dialyzer | xref (undefined calls) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `rabbit` (234 modules) | **51**: 18 discrepancy, 33 dead code | **0** (40 "callback info not available" notes) | 0 |
| 7 applications (440 modules) | **101**: 35 discrepancy, 66 dead code | **0** (4 notes) | 7 |

RabbitMQ runs Dialyzer in its own CI, so zero is the expected answer. Every one of Spectra's 51 warnings on `rabbit` is
therefore either a false positive or something Dialyzer cannot see.

## Triage of the 51 warnings of `rabbit`

Full list and verdicts: [`bench/triage/rabbitmq-core.json`](bench/triage/rabbitmq-core.json). Each cause below has a
minimal reproduction in [`bench/repro/`](bench/repro/README.md).

| Cause | Warnings | Verdict |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `[H \| T]` used as a pair (`?MSG(Index, Header)` in `rabbit_fifo*`): the tail is typed as a list | 37 (`rabbit_fifo`, `_v3`, `_v7`, `_v8`) | **false positive**: reproduced; individual lines not all checked by hand |
| `orelse` / `andalso` with a non-boolean right operand | 2 (`rabbit_auth_backend_authn_state`, `mc_compat`) | **false positive**, reproduced |
| Overloaded `-spec` (`(.., blocking) -> ..; (.., non_blocking) -> ..`): only the first clause counts | 2 (`rabbit_khepri`), maybe 2 more | **false positive**, reproduced |
| Clause or guard that the declared `-spec` rules out (`rabbit_amqp_util`, `rabbit_definitions` x2, `rabbit_vhost_limit` x2) | 5 | **debatable**: true against the contract (defensive code), Dialyzer is silent |
| Not looked at yet (`rabbit_variable_queue`, `rabbit_peer_discovery`, `rabbit_fifo_index`, `rabbit_feature_flags`, `rabbit_ff_controller`) | 5 | pending |

So **at least 41 of 51 are false positives and none of the 51 is a confirmed real defect**. Spectra's promise of zero false
positives does not hold on this code yet, and the three causes above are good first candidates for regression tests.

## Not yet measured

- Gradual contract mismatches (115 on `rabbit`) against Gradualizer: not installed where it can be found.
- Oxbow (80 on `rabbit`) against xref's unused locals: xref reports 0 because the compiler already warns on them, so the
  80 are mostly "ignored parameter" findings, which have no counterpart in the other tools.
- False negatives: needs the seeded-fault corpus.
- Dialyzer with a full PLT of the dependencies (this run lacks it, so it sees fewer calls).
